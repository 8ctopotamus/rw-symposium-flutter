We believe that wealth is not about money; rather, itâ€™s about leading a fulfilling life. We believe itâ€™s important for Americans to work with a professional who understands both the industry and their personal situation, who can help them implement a strategy that makes sense for them. Finances can be emotional, complex, and overwhelming without the coaching of a professional who can make them aware of opportunities and strategies that will help them avoid financial hardship, reach their financial goals, and ultimately live the life they want to live. The mission of this event is to educate, inspire and motivate you, Americaâ€™s professional advisors, to be the best you can be for your clients and community. We aim to arm you with information, ideas and strategies that will help build your business and ultimately assist you in serving your clients like never before.'),
